This is an Expo React Native project for a game called Pantomime. Use best practices for navigation (react-navigation), Redux, and Redux-Saga. Scaffold and maintain the following screens:
- Home (with a big circle button to create a new game)
- Game Props (with a switch for simple/3-step mode)
- Team 1 Players (form to submit players)
- Team 2 Players (form to submit players)
- Game (main game screen)

Use TypeScript and functional components. Follow idiomatic Expo/React Native patterns.
